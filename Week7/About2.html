    <h2>We strive to develop kids growth in the water during Summertime</h2>
    <p> There is a strong belief in starting your kid at an early age </p>

    <h3>Not only does your child benefit in a swimming pool but with a consistent instructor</h3>
    <p> That is why we have developed a system where once your child has a set package with an instructor they will be with them the entire time and upon request.</p>
